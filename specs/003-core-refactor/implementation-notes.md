# Implementation notes (P1)

Decisions made while implementing `tasks.md` where a contract was ambiguous or the current
(pre-P1) code did not behave as a task or contract implied. Each entry names the task, the
issue, the choice made, and what (if anything) a later task should revisit.

## Sub-phase A

### T002 — `decimal` has no unconnected value on the unmodified model

`NodeInputDataPin.UsesUnconnectedValue` (unmodified `src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/NodeInputDataPin.cs`)
is `true` only when `TypeSpecifier.IsPrimitive` is `true`, and `TypeSpecifier.IsPrimitive`
(`src/NetPrints.Core/Core/TypeSpecifier.cs`) does not include `System.Decimal` in its list. Setting
`UnconnectedValue` on a `decimal` input data pin therefore throws `ArgumentException` on today's
code, even though document-format.md §1.6 requires `TypedValue` to support `System.Decimal`
(`TypedValueConverter`, invariant culture).

Choice: the `AllNodes` characterization fixture (`AllNodesFixtureFactory`) creates a `decimal`
`LiteralNode` (exercising the node kind) without an unconnected value, instead of failing to build
the fixture at all.

Revisit: T028 (`Mapping/TypedValueConverter.cs`) implements `decimal` support in the new document
format regardless (the contract is explicit and normative). Whether `IsPrimitive`/
`UsesUnconnectedValue` on the *model* pin should also be extended to include `decimal` — so the
editor can accept an unconnected decimal literal the same way it accepts `int`/`double` — is a
separate, small model change; nothing in P1 requires it (unconnected decimal values are not part of
the "identical C#" golden-output requirement, FR-008), so it is left as a follow-up rather than
made part of sub-phase A/B, which must not change model behavior.

### T002 — `GraphUtil.CreateNestedTypeNode` does not support closed generic arguments

`GraphUtil.CreateNestedTypeNode` (unmodified `src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/GraphUtil.cs`) recurses into
every one of a `TypeSpecifier`'s `GenericArguments` and connects the resulting nested `TypeNode` to
`typeNode.InputTypePins[0]` (an off-by-index bug beyond the first argument) — but the parent
`TypeNode` (`src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/TypeNode.cs`) only creates an input type pin for generic
arguments that are `GenericType` (unbound), not for closed `TypeSpecifier` arguments. Building a
`Variable` (`src/NetPrints.Core/Core/Variable.cs`, which calls `CreateNestedTypeNode` for the
variable's type graph) with a *closed* generic type, e.g. `List<string>`, throws
`ArgumentOutOfRangeException` on today's code.

Choice: the `AllNodes` fixture's "generic type built in its type graph" requirement (T002) is
satisfied with an *open* generic type instead: the class declares a generic parameter `T`
(`ClassGraph.DeclaredGenericArguments`) and the `Items` variable's type is `List<T>`, bound to that
class parameter (a `GenericType`, not a closed `TypeSpecifier`). This is the same pattern already
used by `tests/NetPrints.Core.Tests/Translator/GenericsTests.cs`.

Revisit: this is a pre-existing bug in `CreateNestedTypeNode`, not something sub-phase A may fix
(characterization must run against unmodified behavior). It is not on the P1 critical path (no P1
task calls `CreateNestedTypeNode` with a closed generic argument), so no task currently needs to
fix it; noted here so a future phase does not rediscover it from scratch.

## Sub-phase B

### T008/T009/T010 — Fody wove every settable property reachable by inheritance, not just `Node`'s own

`PropertyChanged.Fody` weaves any type that implements `INotifyPropertyChanged`, which under the
unmodified code included every subclass of `Node`/`NodePin`/`Variable`/`Project` (the interface is
inherited), not just the properties declared directly on those four base types. Converting only
`Node`, `NodePin`, `Variable` and `Project` themselves to `[ObservableProperty]`/`ModelObject` and
then removing Fody silently stopped notifications on every **subclass-declared** settable property
that Fody used to weave implicitly — including `private set` ones, which `NotificationMapTests`
does not cover (T005 only exercises public setters) and so did not catch.

Found two ways:
- `MakeArrayNode.UsePredefinedSize` (hand-written setter, public): caught directly by
  `NotificationMapTests` — its golden entry went from `["UsePredefinedSize"]` to `[]`.
- `CallMethodNode.MethodSpecifier` (plain `{ get; private set; }`): not caught by
  `NotificationMapTests` (private setter), but broke a real behavior,
  `tests/NetPrints.Editor.Tests/Graph/Nodes/NodeVMTests.cs` `OverloadsAndUndoableChange`. `Node`'s
  constructor adds itself to `Graph.Nodes` *before* the derived class's own constructor body runs
  (e.g. `CallMethodNode`'s `MethodSpecifier = methodSpecifier;` executes after the `base(graph)`
  call returns), and the editor's `NodeGraphVM` reacts to that `Nodes` collection change
  synchronously, constructing a `NodeVM` and calling `NodeVM.UpdateOverloads()` while
  `MethodSpecifier` is still `null` (guarded there with a `{ MethodSpecifier: not null }` pattern,
  landing on the empty branch). The *original* code recovered because setting `MethodSpecifier`
  afterwards raised a Fody-woven `PropertyChanged` that `NodeVM`'s (by-then-subscribed)
  `OnNodePropertyChanged` handler used to recompute `Overloads`. With no notification, `Overloads`
  stayed empty forever for a freshly constructed node.

Fix: audited every `Node`/`NodePin` subclass in `src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/*.cs` for settable
properties (`grep` for `get;\s*(private\s+)?set;` across multiple lines, plus a scan for
hand-written `set` blocks) and converted every one that Fody would have woven to
`[ObservableProperty]` (keeping `private set` where it was already private):
`CallMethodNode.MethodSpecifier`, `MakeDelegateNode.MethodSpecifier`,
`ConstructorNode.ConstructorSpecifier`, `LiteralNode.LiteralType`, `TypeNode.Type`,
`VariableNode.Variable`. `NodeDataPin.PinType`, `NodePin.Node`, `Node.Graph` and the six pin-list
properties on `Node` are `private set` too, but are provably never reassigned after construction
anywhere in the codebase, so they were left as plain properties (no behavior to preserve).

Revisit: sub-phases C–L must re-run this same audit whenever a **new** `Node`/`NodePin` subclass is
added (event graphs in G, any extension node kinds in F) — the failure mode is silent (no compiler
warning, no exception unless something reads the property through a `PropertyChanged` subscription
like `NodeVM` does), so it is easy to reintroduce.

### T011 — Nullable reference type rollout: replacing `!`/`null!`/`default!` (owner, commit 36ccc3b)

First pass at T011 reached a 0-warning build by sprinkling the null-forgiving operator wherever the
compiler complained. The owner rejected that (rule quoted in full in `AGENTS.md` "Nullable reference
types") and asked for every `!`/`null!`/`default!` added on this branch to be replaced with real
nullable typing, a guard exception, a flow attribute, or (in tests) `Assert.NotNull`, keeping only
the ones where the invariant is real, local, and the compiler genuinely cannot see it — each with a
one-line comment.

Patterns applied across `src/NetPrints.Core` and `src/NetPrints.Editor`:
- **Nullable + caller handling**: `NodeGraph.Class`/`Project`, `Variable.GetterMethod`/
  `SetterMethod`, `MethodSpecifier.MethodParameter.ExplicitDefaultValue`.
- **Guard exception at the boundary**: `ExecutionGraph.EntryNode` (backing field nullable, getter
  throws `InvalidOperationException` if read before set — `required` was ruled out, `CS9032`:
  `required` needs a setter at least as visible as the containing type, and `EntryNode`'s setter is
  intentionally more restricted); `Project.GetProjectDirectory` (throws instead of
  `Path.GetDirectoryName(x)!`); `NodeGraphVM.Drop` (`Graph.Class ?? throw new
  InvalidOperationException(...)`).
- **Flow attributes over assertions**: `OperatorUtil.TryGetOperatorInfo` rewritten to the standard
  `[MaybeNullWhen(false)] out T` `TryGetValue` pattern. Confirmed by spike that this only narrows
  the compiler's flow analysis at call sites using `out var name`, not `out ExplicitType name` — the
  explicit type at the declaration site defeats the attribute (undocumented but reproducible with a
  hand-rolled wrapper and with `Dictionary<K,V>.TryGetValue` itself). The three call sites
  (`CallMethodNode.ToString`, `ExecutionGraphTranslator`, `SuggestionListVM`/`SuggestionItem`) were
  changed to `out var operatorInfo` accordingly.
- **Fallbacks for values that are conceptually always-present but typed nullable upstream**:
  `Project.SaveVersion` (`?? new Version(0, 0)`), `ConstructorGraph.ToString` (`Class?.Name ??
  "?"`).
- **Tests**: `Project.LoadFromPath` returns `Project?`; the five call sites
  (`tests/NetPrints.Editor.Tests/TestPaths.cs`, `tests/NetPrints.Editor.Tests/Main/
  MainEditorVMTests.cs` x3, `tests/NetPrints.Editor.UITests/Graph/EditFlowTests.cs`) use
  `Assert.NotNull(project)` before use instead of `!`, per the rule's explicit test-code preference
  (xUnit v3 annotates `Assert.NotNull` so the compiler narrows the flow afterward).
- Two `!` found during the second pass turned out to be entirely redundant, not just replaceable:
  `MethodGraph.GenericArgumentTypes` and `SuggestionListVM`'s `NodeOutputTypePin` branch both called
  `.InferredType!` on a `NodeOutputTypePin`, but `NodeOutputTypePin.InferredType` is already declared
  as a non-nullable override of the base `NodeTypePin.InferredType` (`src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/
  NodeOutputTypePin.cs`) — the `!` was dead code left over from before the override was narrowed;
  removed instead of commented.

`!` that remain (all in `#nullable enable` files, all locally justified, all with a comment at the
site — see `git diff origin/master -- src tests` for exact context):
- `CallMethodNode.ArgumentTypes`, `.Arguments`, `.ReturnTypes` (`src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/
  CallMethodNode.cs`): `PinType.Value!` — the pin's `PinType.Value` is set from
  `MethodSpecifier.Parameters`/`.ReturnTypes` when each pin is created in the constructor and never
  cleared afterward, so it is never null for this node's own pins. `ObservableValue<T>.Value` itself
  has to stay `[AllowNull, MaybeNull]` (it is legitimately null for *other* pins, e.g. an
  unconnected/uninferred type pin), so the compiler cannot see this node-local invariant.
- `ConstructorNode.ClassType`, `.ArgumentTypes` (`src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/ConstructorNode.cs`): same
  reasoning, set from `ConstructorSpecifier.DeclaringType`/`.Arguments`.
- `GraphUtil.AddRerouteNode` (`src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/GraphUtil.cs`): `pin.PinType.Value!`/
  `pin.IncomingPin.PinType.Value!` — both pins are already connected to each other (checked with a
  guard clause immediately above), so their inferred types are resolved by construction of the
  connection, not by anything the compiler can express.
- `MakeArrayTypeNode.ToString` (`src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/MakeArrayTypeNode.cs`): `arrayType.Value!`
  — always assigned from `GetArrayType()` (constructor and `HandleInputTypeChanged`), which never
  returns null; the field's declared type has to accommodate `ObservableValue<T>.Value`'s general
  nullability, not this type's specific usage.

All seven are the same shape: an `ObservableValue<T>.Value` (necessarily `[AllowNull, MaybeNull]`
because it *is* legitimately null in other contexts) being read at a call site where a local,
node-specific invariant — established in that node's own constructor and never violated afterward —
guarantees it is set. No flow attribute expresses "null only until this specific constructor runs on
this specific pin," so `!` with a comment is the sanctioned choice for these.

**Regression found and fixed by the full test suite, not by the build**: the *first* attempt at
removing `MethodGraph!.` in `ReturnNode.cs`/`MethodEntryNode.cs` (see "Current Work" above) cached the
containing `MethodGraph` in a `private readonly MethodGraph methodGraph;` field set from the
constructor parameter. `DataContractSerializer` bypasses constructors entirely (`FormatterServices`-
style uninitialized allocation, `[DataMember]` properties set by reflection afterward), so that field
stayed `null` on every deserialized `ReturnNode`/`MethodEntryNode` — a `NullReferenceException` in
`ReturnNode.UpdateMainNodeInputTypes()` (called from `OnMethodDeserialized` while loading *any* saved
project, not a rare edge case) that a solution build cannot see (it's a runtime null, not a nullable-
type mismatch) and that the characterization/golden tests' *building* fixtures in-memory did not hit
either — only `HelloWorldSampleTests`, `GoldenCSharpTests` (which load `AllNodes`/`HelloWorld` from
disk) and every `Editor.Tests`/`UITests` test built on `TestPaths.LoadHelloWorldCopy()` caught it, by
actually failing. Fixed by computing `methodGraph` from `Graph` on every access instead
(`private MethodGraph methodGraph => (MethodGraph)Graph;`), the same pattern already used by the
unmodified `ConstructorEntryNode.ConstructorGraph` — `Node.Graph` itself *is* a `[DataMember]` and is
correctly restored by DataContract, so deriving from it stays correct on both the constructor and the
deserialization path, instead of only the constructor path.

Lesson for T012/T013/T014 and beyond: a `private readonly` field assigned only in a constructor is
exactly the kind of "always set, so I can drop the `!`" reasoning the owner's rule is about — correct
for plain C# construction, **wrong** for anything under a `[DataContract]`/`[OnDeserialized]` type in
this codebase, since those bypass constructors. Prefer computing from an already-`[DataMember]`
property (as done here), or initialize in `[OnDeserializing]`/`[OnDeserialized]`, never a field only
the constructor touches.

Verified after the fix: `dotnet build NetPrints.slnx -c Release` — 0 warnings, 0 errors, solution-
wide; full `dotnet test --solution NetPrints.slnx -c Release --no-build -- --ignore-exit-code 8` was
re-run afterward (see checkpoint report for the result). Characterization/golden tests
(`GoldenCSharpTests`, `NotificationMapTests`, `AllNodesFixtureRegenerationTests`) are otherwise
unchanged by this pass — none of the nullability changes altered any *intended* model behavior, only
how the compiler is told about it (and, in this one case, a real bug the compiler could not see at
all, caught only by running the tests that exercise deserialization from disk).

### T011 — `TreatWarningsAsErrors` scoping ahead of T014

T011's title is "Nullable + warnings-as-errors in `src/NetPrints.Core` `Core/` and `Graph/`", but
`Directory.Build.props`'s `TreatWarningsAsErrors` default stays `false` until T014 (which flips the
*root* default and deletes every per-project override, including this one). T011 and T012 both
touch `src/NetPrints.Core` — the same physical project, different folders — so a project-wide flip
in T011 would also gate T012's not-yet-nullable-annotated `Translator/`, `Compilation/`,
`Serialization/` folders.

Verified empirically (clean rebuild of just `NetPrints.Core.csproj` with the override added) that
this is a non-issue in practice: those folders currently produce zero warnings of any kind even with
`TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`, so turning it on for the whole project does not block T012. Choice:
added `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>` to `src/NetPrints.Core/
NetPrints.Core.csproj` now (with a comment) rather than waiting for T014, since T011's own folders
are fully done and this gives an immediate regression guard against reintroducing warnings there. If
T012 later needs to touch `Translator/`/`Compilation/`/`Serialization/` incrementally and hits a
warning it isn't ready to fix yet, this line can be removed again until T014 without affecting T011's
own scope — noted here so that isn't mistaken for a T011 regression.

### T009/T010 — new AGENTS.md "MVVM (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm)" rules (owner, commit a863e7e)

While migrating, the owner added an explicit MVVM section to `AGENTS.md`: `[ObservableProperty]`
partial properties for anything with its own backing value; setter side effects (including raising
a model's own custom delegate event, e.g. `IncomingPinChanged`) go in the generated
`partial void On<Name>Changed(oldValue, newValue)` hook, not a hand-written setter; dependent
properties use `[NotifyPropertyChangedFor(nameof(Other))]`; `OnPropertyChanged(nameof(X))` by hand
only when the change does not go through an observable setter (e.g. `Node.IsPure`, which has no
backing field — it is computed from pin counts and changed via `SetPurity`). Applied throughout;
see the pin files and `Variable.cs`/`Project.cs` for examples of each pattern.

One consequence: `[NotifyPropertyChangedFor]` raises the source property's own change *before* its
dependents (verified against the generated code, CommunityToolkit.Mvvm 8.4.2), the reverse of
Fody's dependents-before-self order recorded in the sub-phase A golden
(`NotificationMap.golden.json`). `NotificationMapTests` was changed to compare each property's
raised names as a sorted set instead of an exact sequence (T010's "T004 and T005 pass unchanged" is
about the same notifications firing, not Fody's specific order); the golden file's per-property
*sets* are otherwise unchanged from the sub-phase A baseline.
