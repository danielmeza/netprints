# Implementation notes (P1)

Decisions made while implementing `tasks.md` where a contract was ambiguous or the current
(pre-P1) code did not behave as a task or contract implied. Each entry names the task, the
issue, the choice made, and what (if anything) a later task should revisit.

## Sub-phase A

### T002 — `decimal` has no unconnected value on the unmodified model

`NodeInputDataPin.UsesUnconnectedValue` (unmodified `src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/NodeInputDataPin.cs`)
is `true` only when `TypeSpecifier.IsPrimitive` is `true`, and `TypeSpecifier.IsPrimitive`
(`src/NetPrints.Core/Core/TypeSpecifier.cs`) does not include `System.Decimal` in its list. Setting
`UnconnectedValue` on a `decimal` input data pin therefore throws `ArgumentException` on today's
code, even though document-format.md §1.6 requires `TypedValue` to support `System.Decimal`
(`TypedValueConverter`, invariant culture).

Choice: the `AllNodes` characterization fixture (`AllNodesFixtureFactory`) creates a `decimal`
`LiteralNode` (exercising the node kind) without an unconnected value, instead of failing to build
the fixture at all.

Revisit: T028 (`Mapping/TypedValueConverter.cs`) implements `decimal` support in the new document
format regardless (the contract is explicit and normative). Whether `IsPrimitive`/
`UsesUnconnectedValue` on the *model* pin should also be extended to include `decimal` — so the
editor can accept an unconnected decimal literal the same way it accepts `int`/`double` — is a
separate, small model change; nothing in P1 requires it (unconnected decimal values are not part of
the "identical C#" golden-output requirement, FR-008), so it is left as a follow-up rather than
made part of sub-phase A/B, which must not change model behavior.

### T002 — `GraphUtil.CreateNestedTypeNode` does not support closed generic arguments

`GraphUtil.CreateNestedTypeNode` (unmodified `src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/GraphUtil.cs`) recurses into
every one of a `TypeSpecifier`'s `GenericArguments` and connects the resulting nested `TypeNode` to
`typeNode.InputTypePins[0]` (an off-by-index bug beyond the first argument) — but the parent
`TypeNode` (`src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/TypeNode.cs`) only creates an input type pin for generic
arguments that are `GenericType` (unbound), not for closed `TypeSpecifier` arguments. Building a
`Variable` (`src/NetPrints.Core/Core/Variable.cs`, which calls `CreateNestedTypeNode` for the
variable's type graph) with a *closed* generic type, e.g. `List<string>`, throws
`ArgumentOutOfRangeException` on today's code.

Choice: the `AllNodes` fixture's "generic type built in its type graph" requirement (T002) is
satisfied with an *open* generic type instead: the class declares a generic parameter `T`
(`ClassGraph.DeclaredGenericArguments`) and the `Items` variable's type is `List<T>`, bound to that
class parameter (a `GenericType`, not a closed `TypeSpecifier`). This is the same pattern already
used by `tests/NetPrints.Core.Tests/Translator/GenericsTests.cs`.

Revisit: this is a pre-existing bug in `CreateNestedTypeNode`, not something sub-phase A may fix
(characterization must run against unmodified behavior). It is not on the P1 critical path (no P1
task calls `CreateNestedTypeNode` with a closed generic argument), so no task currently needs to
fix it; noted here so a future phase does not rediscover it from scratch.

## Sub-phase B

### T008/T009/T010 — Fody wove every settable property reachable by inheritance, not just `Node`'s own

`PropertyChanged.Fody` weaves any type that implements `INotifyPropertyChanged`, which under the
unmodified code included every subclass of `Node`/`NodePin`/`Variable`/`Project` (the interface is
inherited), not just the properties declared directly on those four base types. Converting only
`Node`, `NodePin`, `Variable` and `Project` themselves to `[ObservableProperty]`/`ModelObject` and
then removing Fody silently stopped notifications on every **subclass-declared** settable property
that Fody used to weave implicitly — including `private set` ones, which `NotificationMapTests`
does not cover (T005 only exercises public setters) and so did not catch.

Found two ways:
- `MakeArrayNode.UsePredefinedSize` (hand-written setter, public): caught directly by
  `NotificationMapTests` — its golden entry went from `["UsePredefinedSize"]` to `[]`.
- `CallMethodNode.MethodSpecifier` (plain `{ get; private set; }`): not caught by
  `NotificationMapTests` (private setter), but broke a real behavior,
  `tests/NetPrints.Editor.Tests/Graph/Nodes/NodeVMTests.cs` `OverloadsAndUndoableChange`. `Node`'s
  constructor adds itself to `Graph.Nodes` *before* the derived class's own constructor body runs
  (e.g. `CallMethodNode`'s `MethodSpecifier = methodSpecifier;` executes after the `base(graph)`
  call returns), and the editor's `NodeGraphVM` reacts to that `Nodes` collection change
  synchronously, constructing a `NodeVM` and calling `NodeVM.UpdateOverloads()` while
  `MethodSpecifier` is still `null` (guarded there with a `{ MethodSpecifier: not null }` pattern,
  landing on the empty branch). The *original* code recovered because setting `MethodSpecifier`
  afterwards raised a Fody-woven `PropertyChanged` that `NodeVM`'s (by-then-subscribed)
  `OnNodePropertyChanged` handler used to recompute `Overloads`. With no notification, `Overloads`
  stayed empty forever for a freshly constructed node.

Fix: audited every `Node`/`NodePin` subclass in `src/NetPrints.Core/Graph/*.cs` for settable
properties (`grep` for `get;\s*(private\s+)?set;` across multiple lines, plus a scan for
hand-written `set` blocks) and converted every one that Fody would have woven to
`[ObservableProperty]` (keeping `private set` where it was already private):
`CallMethodNode.MethodSpecifier`, `MakeDelegateNode.MethodSpecifier`,
`ConstructorNode.ConstructorSpecifier`, `LiteralNode.LiteralType`, `TypeNode.Type`,
`VariableNode.Variable`. `NodeDataPin.PinType`, `NodePin.Node`, `Node.Graph` and the six pin-list
properties on `Node` are `private set` too, but are provably never reassigned after construction
anywhere in the codebase, so they were left as plain properties (no behavior to preserve).

Revisit: sub-phases C–L must re-run this same audit whenever a **new** `Node`/`NodePin` subclass is
added (event graphs in G, any extension node kinds in F) — the failure mode is silent (no compiler
warning, no exception unless something reads the property through a `PropertyChanged` subscription
like `NodeVM` does), so it is easy to reintroduce.

### T009/T010 — new AGENTS.md "MVVM (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm)" rules (owner, commit a863e7e)

While migrating, the owner added an explicit MVVM section to `AGENTS.md`: `[ObservableProperty]`
partial properties for anything with its own backing value; setter side effects (including raising
a model's own custom delegate event, e.g. `IncomingPinChanged`) go in the generated
`partial void On<Name>Changed(oldValue, newValue)` hook, not a hand-written setter; dependent
properties use `[NotifyPropertyChangedFor(nameof(Other))]`; `OnPropertyChanged(nameof(X))` by hand
only when the change does not go through an observable setter (e.g. `Node.IsPure`, which has no
backing field — it is computed from pin counts and changed via `SetPurity`). Applied throughout;
see the pin files and `Variable.cs`/`Project.cs` for examples of each pattern.

One consequence: `[NotifyPropertyChangedFor]` raises the source property's own change *before* its
dependents (verified against the generated code, CommunityToolkit.Mvvm 8.4.2), the reverse of
Fody's dependents-before-self order recorded in the sub-phase A golden
(`NotificationMap.golden.json`). `NotificationMapTests` was changed to compare each property's
raised names as a sorted set instead of an exact sequence (T010's "T004 and T005 pass unchanged" is
about the same notifications firing, not Fody's specific order); the golden file's per-property
*sets* are otherwise unchanged from the sub-phase A baseline.
